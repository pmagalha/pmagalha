### 👋 Hello everybodyyy! 
My name is Pedro Eduardo and I've been doing a loads of stuff! I majored in Asian Studies and developed an aquired taste for learning languages at an early age. Now I am reinventing myself and learning programming languages as well, such as C, which I am 
currently doing by taking School 42's common course. I've always regarded myself as a creative type, being a professional musician and a content creator, and I hope to bring this side of mine into the programming world too.
I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others, and in this page you will find all my progress throughout the whole 42 experience. Big believer in the s𝙚𝙡𝙛-𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩 approach and forever learner 🌱
